## Chest

Inspect:

- Distress
- Asymmetry
- Deformity

## Neck

Palpate trachea.

## Lung

Diaphram auscultate:

- Anterior 2 levels
- Lateral 2 levels
- Posterior 3 levels

Percuss:

- Posterior 3 levels

(When percussing, any fluid inside or outside the airway results in dullness.)

(When auscultating, any fluid inside the airway results in more resonance but any fluid outside the airway results in less resonance.)

(The 2nd level should be at the triangle made of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and scapula.)
