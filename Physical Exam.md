## Radial Pulse

Systolic blood pressure of 80 is required.

Measure heart rate and check if the rhythm is regular.

## Blood Pressure

## Jagular Vein Pulsation

Have the patient angle at 45 degrees and turn the head to the left, and measure the distance from the sternal angle to a pulsation.
It should be less than 5cm.

## Carotid Pulse

Systolic blood pressure of 60 is required.

Do one side at a time.

Palpate.

Have the patient take a deep breath and hold, and bell auscultate.

## Heart

Feel the apex, the point of maximal impact.
It is palpable in 25% of adults.

Diaphram auscultate LLSB, LICS2, the apex, and RICS2.

Bell auscultate the apex.

In the left lateral position, bell auscultate the apex.
Hear for S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.

Have the patinet sit forward and exhale a deep breath, diaphram auscultate LLSB.
Hear for aortic regurgitation.

## Peripheral Pulse

Check pulse from:

- Brachial artery
- Popliteal artery
- Distal tibial artery
- Dorsalis pedis artery

## Peripheral Edema

Press distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.

## Chest

Inspect:
- Distress
- Asymmetry
- Deformity
- Skin abnormality

## Neck

Palpate trachea.

## Lung

At each level, do the right side first and compare to the left side.

When percussing, any fluid (inside or outside the airway) results in dullness.

When auscultating, any fluid inside the airway results in more resonance but any fluid outside the airway results in less resonance.

Diaphram auscultate:
- Anterior 2 levels
- Lateral 2 levels
- Posterior 3 levels

Percuss:
- Posterior 3 levels

The 2nd level should be at the triangle made of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and scapula.

## Abdomen

Inspect:
- Contour
- Mass
- Vein
- Movement

Diaphram auscultate the center.

Percuss all areas.

All areas but starting furthest from any pain, palpate superficially and then deeply.

Press slowly and then release quickly.

### Abdominal Aorta

Palpate and size.
The diameter should be less than 3cm.

### Liver

Percuss and size.
The height should be less than 12cm.

While the patient exhales a deep breath, palpate.

### Kidney

Press costovertebral angle.

Sandwitch palpate.

### Spleen

Have the patient continuously take deep breaths, and percuss and size.
The height should be less than 7cm.

Have the patient exhale a deep breath, and sandwitch palpate.
