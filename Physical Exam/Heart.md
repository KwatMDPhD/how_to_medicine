## Check radial artery.

Measure heart rate and rhythm.
Rhythm is regular or not.

(Systolic blood pressure of at least 80 leads to radial pulse.)

## Measure blood pressure

## Measure jagular venous pulsation

Have patient angle at 45 degrees and turn head to the left, measure distance from sternal angle to pulsation.
Angle of Louis to the the top of the pulse should be 5cm.

## Check carotid pulse

(Systolic blood pressure of at least 60 leads to carotid pulse.)

One side at a time, feel artery.

One side at a time, have patient take a deep breath and hold, and (bell) auscultate artery.

## Check heart

Feel apex (point of maximal impact), which is palpable only in 25% of adults.

(Diaphram) auscultate LLSB, LICS2, apex, and RICS2.

Bell is good at hearing low frequency sounds of S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.

(Bell) auscultate apex.

(Bell) auscultate the apex in the left lateral position.
For S3, S4, and mitral stenosis murmurs.

(Diaphram) auscultate left sternal border and apex in the sitting forward position with exhalation.
For aortic regurgitation murmurs.

## Check peripheral pulse

Brachial artery

Popliteal artery

Distal tibial artery

Dorsalis pedis artery

## Check peripheral edema

Push distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.
