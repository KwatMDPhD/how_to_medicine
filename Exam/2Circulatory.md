## Radial Artery

(Systolic blood pressure of 80 is required.)

Measure heart rate and check if the rhythm is regular.

## Jagular Vein

Have the patient angle at 45 degrees and turn the head to the left, and measure the distance from the sternal angle to a pulsation.
(It should be less than 5cm.)

## Carotid Artery

(Systolic blood pressure of 60 is required.)

One side at a time, palpate.

One side at a time, have the patient take a deep breath and hold, and bell auscultate.

## Heart

Feel the apex.
(It is palpable in 25% of adults.)

Diaphram auscultate LLSB, LICS2, the apex, and RICS2.

Bell auscultate the apex.

In the left lateral position, bell auscultate the apex.
(Hear for S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.)

Have the patinet sit forward and exhale a deep breath, diaphram auscultate LLSB.
(Hear for aortic regurgitation.)

## Peripheral Artery

Check pulse from:

- Brachial artery
- Popliteal artery
- Distal tibial artery
- Dorsalis pedis artery

## Lower Extremity

Press distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.
